# molnterms
The Terms of Service of Moln Bot.

# rules
The user should refrain from making the bot say heinous things, such as racist, sexist, homophobic, deregatory, etc. The commands in which the bot responds are a privilege, not a right. If you cannot refrain from this, I will completely get rid of it.

We serve all right to blacklist you from further usage of our discord bot. No reason of any sort is guaranteed, however we will try our best to do so.

# data collection
The bot collects data such as guilds, members, channels, and other forms of data needed to ensure the bot can function. The bot has been made to completely get rid of this data as soon as the bot is removed from your guild. If you wish to contact me about ensuring your data is successfully removed, LocalHotJew#3246 on discord, or run >invite for support on this. 

What is this information used for? AFK, reminder, guild info, user info, levels, logs, change prefix, and more. It is solely to help your guild. Again, if you do not want this make sure to contact me or my support server with >invite.
